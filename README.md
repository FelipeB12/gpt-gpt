# gpt-gpt
This chat is to be able to modify the behavior of gpt chat completely adaptable with the API  

- Here you can find the follow-up of the video "Crea una APP con PYTHON y CHATGPT desde cero - MoureDev by Brais Moure "

- I have commented all the code explaining every line and function so it will be easier to manipulate, as there has been some changes since the video was posted, but now the code is updated to today 10/04/2024, do not forget you will need your own API key.
